# Movie Rating Prediction Project

## Overview
The Movie Rating Prediction project is a machine learning application designed to predict movie ratings based on user preferences, movie features, and historical ratings. This project utilizes collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, or hybrid recommendation systems to create accurate predictions and improve user experience.

## Objective
The primary goal of this project is to predict the rating a user would give to a specific movie. This can be achieved using machine learning techniques applied to datasets containing user reviews, movie metadata, and historical ratings.

## Dataset
The dataset for this project can be sourced from platforms such as [MovieLens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/), which provides datasets with user ratings, or similar open datasets. The dataset typically contains:

- **User ID**: Unique identifier for each user.
- **Movie ID**: Unique identifier for each movie.
- **Rating**: User-assigned rating for a movie (e.g., 1-5 stars).
- **Timestamp**: When the rating was given.
- **Movie Features**: Metadata about movies such as title, genres, release year, etc.

## Steps Involved
### 1. Data Loading and Exploration
- Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
- Explore the data for missing values, inconsistencies, and overall structure.
- Perform descriptive statistics to understand key insights.

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- Handle missing data by imputing or removing incomplete entries.
- Encode categorical variables like genres or user preferences.
- Normalize numerical data if required.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualize rating distributions and trends over time.
- Identify correlations between features.
- Analyze user and movie behavior (e.g., top-rated movies, most active users).

### 4. Model Development
Choose an approach for the prediction model:

- **Collaborative Filtering**:
  - Use matrix factorization techniques like Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) or Alternating Least Squares (ALS).
  - Implement user-user or item-item similarity algorithms.

- **Content-Based Filtering**:
  - Leverage movie metadata (e.g., genres, actors) to create user profiles and predict ratings.

- **Hybrid Models**:
  - Combine collaborative and content-based techniques for improved accuracy.

### 5. Model Training and Evaluation
- Split the data into training and test sets.
- Train the selected model(s) on the training data.
- Evaluate using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and precision-recall for recommendations.

### 6. Prediction
- Use the trained model to predict ratings for unseen data.
- Generate top-N movie recommendations for users.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas` and `numpy` for data manipulation.
  - `scikit-learn` for machine learning algorithms.
  - `surprise` for building and evaluating recommendation systems.
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization.

## Results
The project aims to achieve high prediction accuracy for user ratings and generate personalized movie recommendations. The evaluation metrics will help determine the effectiveness of the model.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Install the required Python libraries using:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to preprocess the data, train the model, and generate predictions.
4. Modify the code to experiment with different algorithms or datasets.

## Key Files
